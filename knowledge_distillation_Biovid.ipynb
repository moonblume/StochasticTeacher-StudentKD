    "to predict one of the following classes for each input signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input signals are numerical values, so they have 1 channel and are one-dimensional. Each signal is represented by a sequence of numerical values, typically sampled at regular intervals. To avoid saturation and improve numerical stability, a normalization process is performed on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normalization process for signals involves scaling the input values to a specific range, often [-1, 1] or [0, 1]. This can be achieved by applying various techniques such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization. Min-max scaling maps the input values to a range between 0 and 1, while z-score normalization standardizes the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By normalizing the input signals, we ensure that the data falls within a reasonable range for processing by the neural network. This helps prevent issues such as gradient saturation and improves the overall stability and convergence of the training process.\n"

    "now let\\'s focus on their hidden states rather than their output layers.  \n",
    "The goal is to convey information from the teacher\\'s representation to\n",
    "the student by including a naive loss function, whose minimization\n",
    "implies that the flattened vectors that are subsequently passed to the\n",
    "classifiers have become more *similar* as the loss decreases. Of course,\n",
    "the teacher does not update its weights, so the minimization depends\n",
    "only on the student\\'s weights.   The rationale behind this method is that\n",
    "I am  operating under the assumption that the teacher model has a\n",
    "better internal representation that is unlikely to be achieved by the\n",
    "student without external intervention, therefore we artificially push\n",
    "the student to mimic the internal representation of the teacher. Whether\n",
    "or not this will end up helping the student is not straightforward,\n",
    "though, because pushing the lightweight network to reach this point\n",
    "could be a good thing, assuming that I have found an internal\n",
    "representation that leads to better test accuracy, but it could also be\n",
    "harmful because the networks have different architectures and the\n",
    "student does not have the same learning capacity as the teacher. In\n",
    "other words, there is no reason for these two vectors, the student\\'s\n",
    "and the teacher\\'s to match per component. The student could reach an\n",
